    "postersAbout": "You are welcome to submit a poster upon registration for the conference. These posters, much like the student talks, can be about anything in the mathematical sciences. They may be expository posters about a particular problem or topic, displays of projects, or anything else which may be better suited in a poster format as opposed to a talk. All posters will be presented during a one-hour session, where attendees can move between the different posters.",
